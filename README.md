# Service repositories pattern : Typescript

	## Why service repository pattern?
	   Spliting logic: Specific places for different requirements, controllers, business logic, database all have own placeholders.
	   Better testing experience: Each placeholder can have defined testing scope.
           Scales better for lager project, beyond CRUD
